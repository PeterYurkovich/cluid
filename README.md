# cluid

CLuster UI Deployment (cluid) is going to be used as a place for the observability-ui-team to place there setup configurations for our many different types. Hack folders can help, but our requirements span across projects, leading to dependancies and requirements getting outdated quickly. And often these requirements will stay outdated until the next time a project is used, at which point there could be multiple sequences of updates needed.

On a personal side this project will give me an oportunity to continue to learn go, work on a TUI for the first time, and finally get around to learning go routines.

This project will be based on the [charmbracelet](https://github.com/charmbracelet) stack, with plans to use [bubbletea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea?tab=readme-ov-file), [bubbles](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbles), and [log](https://github.com/charmbracelet/log), with potential to expand to use [Huh](https://github.com/charmbracelet/huh) as well if needed.
